## [2.10.5] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- `optionalDependencies` in published `gsd-pi@2.10.4` were still pinned to `2.10.2`, causing users to install the broken engine binaries that 2.10.4 was meant to fix (#276)

## [2.10.4] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- Native binary distribution — `.node` binaries were missing from the npm tarball, causing startup crashes on all platforms since v2.10.0
- Native loader resolution chain: tries `@gsd-build/engine-{platform}` npm package first, then local dev build, with clear error messages listing supported platforms

### Added
- Per-platform optional dependency packages (`@gsd-build/engine-*`) for macOS (ARM64/x64), Linux (x64/ARM64), and Windows (x64)
- Cross-platform native binary CI build and publish workflow
- Version synchronization script for lock-step platform package releases

## [2.10.2] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Native Rust TTSR regex engine — pre-compiles all stream rule conditions into a single `RegexSet` for one-pass DFA matching instead of O(rules × conditions) JS regex iteration
- Native Rust diff engine — fuzzy text matching (`fuzzyFindText`, `normalizeForFuzzyMatch`) and unified diff generation (`generateDiff`) via the `similar` crate, replacing the `diff` npm package

## [2.10.1] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- `@gsd/native` package ships pre-compiled JavaScript instead of raw TypeScript, fixing startup crashes on Node.js 20, 22, and 24 (#248)

## [2.10.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Native Rust engine with high-performance N-API modules replacing JS/WASM dependencies:
  - **grep** — ripgrep-backed content and filesystem search
  - **glob** — gitignore-aware file discovery with scan caching
  - **ps** — cross-platform process tree management
  - **clipboard** — native clipboard access via arboard (text + image)
  - **highlight** — syntect-based syntax highlighting (replaces `cli-highlight`)
  - **ast** — structural code search and rewrite via ast-grep (38+ languages)
  - **html** — HTML-to-Markdown conversion
  - **text** — ANSI-aware text measurement, wrapping, truncation, and slicing
  - **fd** — fuzzy file path discovery for autocomplete
  - **image** — decode, encode, and resize images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP)
- Background shell `env` action to query shell session environment state
- Background shell `run` action for blocking command execution on persistent sessions

- `/thinking` slash command for toggling thinking level during sessions
- Interactive wizard mode for `/gsd prefs` with guided configuration
- Startup update check with 24-hour cache — notifies when a new version is available

### Fixed

## [2.8.3] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- `ask_user_questions` handles undefined `custom()` result in RPC mode
- Provider-aware model resolution for per-phase preferences (respects `provider` field instead of parsing model name prefixes)
- Execute-task artifact verification aligned with `deriveState` — adds self-repair for missing artifacts
- Research phase infinite loop broken; state synced on stop
- Auto-resolve merge conflicts on `.gsd/` runtime files
- Auto-switch model after `/login` and `/logout` to prevent API key errors
- Anthropic provider detection uses `provider` field instead of model name prefix matching

## [2.8.2] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- Path operations use `node:path` stdlib instead of hardcoded forward slashes, fixing cross-platform compatibility
- Prompts use relative paths to prevent Windows drive letter mangling

### Added
- Discussion depth verification and context write-gate for richer milestone discussions
- TTSR + blob/artifact storage (ported from oh-my-pi)
- Skip/discard escape hatches in no-roadmap wizard
- Configurable `merge_strategy` preference for slice completion

### Fixed
- `fsevents` bumped to ~2.3.3 for Node 25 compatibility; added as optional dep for Linux installs
- Observability warnings injected into agent prompt for enforcement

- Browser tools: `browser_analyze_form` and `browser_fill_form` — form field inventory and intelligent filling by label/name/placeholder
- Browser tools: `browser_find_best` — scored element candidates for semantic intents
- Browser tools: `browser_act` — execute common browser micro-tasks in one call
- Browser tools: 108 unit and integration tests covering all new components

### Changed
- Browser tools: decomposed 5000-line monolithic `index.ts` into focused modules (state, capture, settle, lifecycle, refs, utils) with 11 categorized tool files
- Browser tools: consolidated state capture reduces evaluate round-trips per action
- Browser tools: zero-mutation settle short-circuit for faster page interaction
- Browser tools: conditional body text capture — low-signal tools skip it for smaller token payloads
- Browser tools: screenshot resizing uses `sharp` instead of canvas evaluate calls
- Browser tools: screenshots opt-in on navigate (no longer sent by default)

## [2.7.1] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Model fallback support for auto-mode phases — if the configured model fails, GSD tries alternate models before stopping
- `/kill` command for immediate process termination

### Fixed
- `npm install -g gsd-pi` now works — workspace packages bundled in npm tarball via `bundleDependencies`
- External PI ecosystem packages (pi-rtk, pi-context, etc.) can now resolve `@mariozechner/*` imports through jiti aliases
- Missing `export-html` vendor files (marked.min.js, highlight.min.js) restored
- Skipped API keys now persist so the setup wizard doesn't repeat on every launch
- Provider config and extension loading reused correctly

### Changed
- `/exit` uses graceful shutdown (saves session state); `/kill` replaces the old immediate-exit behavior

## [2.7.0] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
- Vendor Pi SDK source (tui, ai, agent-core, coding-agent) into workspace monorepo under `packages/`, replacing the compiled npm dependency and patch-package workflow. Pi internals are now directly modifiable as TypeScript source.
- Existing patches (setModel persist option, Windows VT input caching) applied as source edits.
- Build pipeline runs workspace packages in dependency order before GSD compilation.
- Removed `patch-package` from devDependencies and postinstall.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Proactive secret management — planning phase forecasts required API keys into a manifest; auto-mode collects pending secrets before dispatching the first slice
- `--continue` / `-c` CLI flag to resume the most recent session

### Fixed
- Doctor post-hook no longer preempts `complete-slice` dispatch
- `main_branch` preference restored; `runPreMergeCheck` implemented for merge safety
- Recovery/retry prompt injection capped to prevent V8 OOM on large sessions
- `.gsd/` excluded from pre-switch auto-commits to prevent squash merge conflicts

## [2.5.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- `secure_env_collect` now auto-detects existing keys, destination files, and provides guidance field for better onboarding UX

### Changed
- Right-sized pipeline for simple work — single-slice milestones skip redundant research/plan sessions, reducing 9-10 sessions to 5-6
- Heavyweight plan sections (Proof Level, Integration Closure, Observability) are now conditional, omitted for simple slices

### Fixed
- Squash-merge now aborts cleanly on conflict and stops auto-mode instead of looping with corrupted state
- Resolved baked-in merge conflict markers in loader.ts, logo.ts, and postinstall.js

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Native Anthropic web search — Claude models get server-side web search automatically, no Brave API key required
- GitService fully wired into codebase — programmatic git operations replace shell-based git commands in prompts
- Merge guards prevent slice completion when uncommitted changes or conflicts exist
- Snapshot support for saving and restoring `.gsd/` state
- Auto-push after slice squash-merge to main
- Rich commit messages with structured metadata

### Fixed
- State machine deadlock when units fail to produce expected artifacts — retry and cross-validation now gate completion
- Duplicate Brave search tools when toggling providers repeatedly
- Windows test glob patterns (single quotes → unquoted for shell expansion)
- Conversation replay error caused by thinking blocks in stored history
- Brave search tools removed from API payload when no `BRAVE_API_KEY` is set
- Restore notifications suppressed on session resume to reduce UX noise

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Automatic migration of provider credentials from existing Pi installations — skip re-authentication when switching to GSD

- `gsd config` subcommand to re-run the setup wizard anytime
- Shared `src/logo.ts` module as single source of truth for ASCII banner

### Fixed
- Parallel subagent results no longer truncated at 200 characters

### Changed
- `wizard.ts` trimmed to env hydration only — onboarding logic moved to `onboarding.ts`
- First-launch banner removed from `loader.ts` (onboarding wizard handles branding)

## [2.3.10] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Branded postinstall experience with animated spinners, progress indicators, and clean summary (#115)

### Fixed
- Ctrl+Alt shortcuts (dashboard, bg manager, voice) now show slash-command fallback in terminals that lack Kitty keyboard protocol support — macOS Terminal.app, JetBrains IDEs (#100, #104)

- Auto-mode merge guard handles all slice completion paths, preventing infinite dispatch loops when `complete-slice` is bypassed (#71)

## [2.3.7] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- Remote user questions via Slack/Discord for headless auto-mode sessions

### Fixed
- Auto-mode model switches no longer persist as the user's global default (#30)
- Auto-mode resume now rebuilds disk state and runs doctor before dispatching, preventing inline execution after pause (#16)
- Silent dispatch failure when command context is null now surfaces an error notification
- Race condition between timeout handlers and prompt dispatch in auto-mode
- Remote questions: validate IDs before test-send, sanitize error messages to prevent token leakage
