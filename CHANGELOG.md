## [2.20.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Telegram remote questions** — receive and respond to GSD questions via Telegram bot alongside existing Slack and Discord channels (#645)
- **`/gsd quick`** — execute a quick task with GSD guarantees (atomic commits, state tracking) without the full planning overhead (#437)
- **`/gsd mode`** — workflow mode system with solo and team presets that configure defaults for milestone IDs, git commit behavior, and documentation settings (#651)
- **`/gsd help`** — categorized command reference with descriptions for all GSD subcommands (#630)
- **`/gsd doctor`** — 7 runtime health checks with auto-fix for common state corruption issues (#646)

- **Model config bleed between concurrent GSD instances** — isolated model configuration per session (#650)
- **Onboarding wizard repeats** — skip onboarding for extension-based providers that don't require auth.json credentials (#589)
- **Session tool rebuild on cwd change** — tools now rebuild correctly when working directory changes mid-session (#633)
- **Auto mode state derivation after discussion fallthrough** — re-derives state to prevent stale dispatches (#609)
- **Milestone branch preservation on auto stop** — prevents work loss when stopping auto mode (#601)
- **Infinite loop when milestone detection silently fails** — `findMilestoneIds` now logs errors and warns instead of looping (#456)

- **YAML support in hooks** — hooks now support YAML configuration alongside JSON (#637)

## [2.19.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Workflow visualizer** — `/gsd visualize` opens a full-screen TUI overlay with four tabs: Progress (milestone/slice/task tree), Dependencies (ASCII dep graph), Metrics (cost/token bar charts), and Timeline (chronological execution history). Supports Tab/1-4 switching, per-tab scrolling, auto-refresh every 2s, and optional auto-trigger after milestone completion via `auto_visualize` preference (#626)
- **Mid-execution capture & triage** — `/gsd capture` lets you fire-and-forget thoughts during auto-mode. The system triages accumulated captures at natural seams between tasks, classifies impact into five types (quick-task, inject, defer, replan, note), and proposes action with user confirmation. Dashboard shows pending capture count badge. Capture context injected into replan and reassess prompts (#512)
- **Dynamic model routing** — complexity-based model routing classifies units into light/standard/heavy tiers and routes to cheaper models when appropriate, reducing token consumption 20-50% on capped plans. Includes budget-pressure-aware routing, cross-provider cost comparison, escalation on failure, adaptive learning from routing history (rolling 50-entry window with user feedback support), and task plan introspection (code block counting, complexity keyword detection) (#579)
- **Feature-branch lifecycle integration test** — proves milestone worktrees branch from and merge back to feature branches, never touching main (#624)
- **Discord integration parity with Slack** — plus new remote-questions documentation (#620)

### Fixed
- **Absolute paths in auto-mode prompts** — write-target variables now passed as absolute paths, eliminating LLM path confusion in worktree contexts that caused artifacts written to wrong location and loop detection (#627)
- **Worktree lifecycle on mid-session milestone transitions** (#616, #618)
- **Eager template cache warming** — prevents version-skew crash in long auto-mode sessions (#621)

## [2.18.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Milestone queue reorder** — `/gsd queue` supports reordering milestone execution priority with dependency-aware validation, persistent ordering via `.gsd/QUEUE-ORDER.json` (#460)
- **`.gsd/KNOWLEDGE.md`** — persistent project-specific context file loaded into agent prompts. New `/gsd knowledge` command with `rule`, `pattern`, and `lesson` subcommands for adding entries (#585)
- **Dynamic model discovery** — runtime model enumeration from provider APIs (Ollama, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter) with per-provider TTL caching and discovery adapters. New `ProviderManagerComponent` TUI for managing providers with auth status and model counts (#581)
- **Expanded preferences wizard** — all configurable fields now exposed in the setup wizard, model ID validation, and `updatePreferencesModels()` for safe read-modify-write of model config (#580)
- **Comprehensive documentation** — 12 new docs covering getting started, auto-mode, commands, configuration, token optimization, cost management, git strategy, team workflows, skills, migration, troubleshooting, and architecture (#605)
- **`resolveProjectRoot()`** — all GSD commands resolve the effective project root from worktree paths instead of using raw `process.cwd()`, preventing path confusion across worktree boundaries (#602)
- **1,813 lines of new tests** — 13 new test files covering discovery cache, model discovery, model registry, models-json-writer, auto-worktree, derive-state-deps, in-flight tool tracking, knowledge, memory leak guards, preferences wizard fields, queue order, queue reorder E2E, and stale worktree cwd

### Fixed
- **Heap OOM during long-running auto-mode sessions** — four sources of unbounded memory growth: activity log serialized all entries for SHA1 dedup (now streaming writes with lightweight fingerprint), uncleaned `activityLogState` Map between sessions, unbounded `completedUnits` array (now capped at 200), and `dirEntryCache`/`dirListCache` growing without bounds (now evicted at 200 entries) (#611)
- **Stale worktree cwd after milestone completion** — three-layer fix: `escapeStaleWorktree()` at auto-mode entry, unconditional cwd restore in `stopAuto()`, and cwd restore on partial merge failure (#608)
- **Worktree created from integration branch instead of main** — `createAutoWorktree` reads integration branch from META.json, merge targets integration branch not hardcoded main (#606)
- **Milestone merge skipped in branch isolation mode** — branch-mode fallback detects `milestone/*` branch and performs squash-merge (#603)
- **`parseContextDependsOn()` destroys unique milestone ID case** — was lowercasing IDs, breaking dependency resolution (#604)
- **Tool-aware idle detection** — prevents false interruption of long-running tasks in auto-mode (#596)
- **Remote questions onboarding crash** — extracted `saveRemoteQuestionsConfig` into compiled src/ helper to avoid cross-boundary .ts import (#592)
- **`showNextAction` crash** — falls back to `select()` when `custom()` returns undefined (#447, #615)

### Changed
- Comprehensive update to preferences reference and configuration guide (#614)
- Auto-mode artifact writes scoped to active milestone worktree, preventing cross-milestone pollution (#590)

## [2.17.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Token optimization profiles** — `budget`, `balanced`, and `quality` presets that coordinate model selection, phase skipping, and context compression to reduce token usage by 40-60% on budget mode
- **Complexity-based task routing** — automatically classifies tasks as simple/standard/heavy and routes to appropriate models, with persistent learning from routing history
- **`git.commit_docs` preference** — set to `false` to keep `.gsd/` planning artifacts local-only, useful for teams where only some members use GSD

### Changed
- Updated Ollama cloud provider model catalog

### Fixed
- Native binary hangs in GSD auto-mode paths (#453)
- Auto-mode can be stopped from a different terminal (#586)

- Native git operations via libgit2 — ~70 fewer process spawns per dispatch cycle
- Native performance optimizations for `deriveState`, JSONL parsing, and path resolution
- Default model upgraded to Opus 4.6 with 1M context variant
- PR template and bug report issue template

### Fixed
- Auto-mode continues after guided milestone planning instead of stalling at "Milestone planned"
- Git commands no longer fail when repo path contains spaces
- Arrow key cursor updates and Shift+Enter newline insertion in TUI
- Tool API keys loaded from `auth.json` at session startup
- TypeScript errors resolved across extension, test, and async-jobs files

### Changed
- Hot-path lookup caching and error resilience optimizations
- Extension type-checking added to CI pipeline

## [2.15.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Auto-mode worktree path resolution — prompt templates now include working directory, preventing artifacts from being written to the wrong location and causing infinite re-dispatches
- Auto-mode resource sync detection — gracefully stops when resources change mid-session instead of crashing
- Auto-mode missing import for `resolveSkillDiscoveryMode` causing crash on startup
- Auto-mode recovery hardened — checkbox verification falls through correctly, corrupt roadmaps fail verification instead of silently passing, atomic writes for completed-units.json, and task completion verified via artifacts not just file existence
- Auto-mode progress widget now refreshes from disk every 5 seconds during unit execution instead of appearing frozen
- Undo command now invalidates all caches (not just state cache), preventing stale results after undoing completed tasks

### Changed
- CI pipeline supports prerelease publishing with `--tag next` for testing before stable release

### Added
- Unit tests for auto-dashboard, auto-recovery, and crash-recovery modules (46 new tests)

## [2.15.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **8 new commands**: budget enforcement, notifications, and quality-of-life improvements (#441)
- **Preferences schema validation**: detects unknown/typo'd preference keys and surfaces warnings instead of silently ignoring them (#542)
- **Pipeline-aware prompts**: each agent phase (research, plan, execute, complete) now knows its role in the pipeline, eliminating redundant code exploration between phases (#543)
- **Research depth calibration**: three-tier system (deep/targeted/light) so agents match effort to actual complexity (#543)

### Changed
- Auto-mode decomposed into focused modules for maintainability (#534)
- Dispatch logic extracted from if-else chain to dispatch table (#539)
- v1 migration code gated behind dynamic import — only loaded when needed (#541)
- Background shell module decomposed into focused modules
- Unified cache invalidation into single `invalidateAllCaches()` function (#545)

### Fixed
- Executor agents now receive explicit working directory, preventing writes to main repo instead of worktree (#543)
- Merge loop and .gsd/ conflict auto-resolution in worktree model, `git.isolation` preference restored (#536)
- Arrow keys no longer insert escape sequences as text during LLM streaming (#493)
- YAML preferences parser hardened for OpenRouter model IDs with special characters (#488)
- `@` file autocomplete debounced to prevent TUI freeze on large codebases (#448)
- Auto-mode stops cleanly when dispatch gap watchdog fails (#537)
- Synchronous I/O removed from hot paths (#540)
- Silent catch blocks now capture error references for crash diagnostics (#546)
- `ctx.log` error in GSD provider recovery path fixed
- TUI resource leaks patched in loader, cancellable-loader, input, and editor components (#482)
- Hardcoded ANSI escapes replaced with chalk for consistent terminal handling (#482)

## [2.14.4] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Session cwd update** — `newSession()` now updates the LLM's perceived working directory to reflect `process.chdir()` into auto-worktrees. Previously the system prompt was frozen at the original project root, causing the LLM to `cd` back and write files to the wrong location. This was the root cause of complete-slice and plan-slice loops in worktree-based projects.

## [2.14.3] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Copy planning artifacts into new auto-worktrees** — `createAutoWorktree` now copies `.gsd/milestones/`, `DECISIONS.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `PROJECT.md` from the source repo into the worktree. Prevents plan-slice loops in projects with pre-v2.14.0 `.gitignore`.

## [2.14.2] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Dispatch reentrancy deadlock** — `_dispatching` flag was never reset after first dispatch, permanently blocking all subsequent unit dispatches. Wrapped in try/finally.
- **`.gitignore` self-heal** — existing projects with blanket `.gsd/` ignore now auto-remove it on next auto-mode start, replacing with explicit runtime-only patterns so planning artifacts are tracked in git.
- **Discuss depth verification** — render summary as chat text (markdown renders), use ask_user_questions for short confirmation only.

## [2.14.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Quiet auto-mode warnings** — internal recovery machinery (dispatch gap watchdog, model fallback chain) downgraded to verbose-only. Users only see warnings when action is needed.
- **Dispatch recovery hardening** — artifact fallback when completion key missing, TUI freeze prevention, reentrancy guard, atomic writes, stale runtime record cleanup

## [2.14.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Discussion manifest** — mechanical process verification for multi-milestone context discussions
- **Session-internal `/gsd config`** — configure GSD settings within a running session
- **Model selection UI** — select list instead of free-text input for model preferences
- **Startup performance** — faster GSD launch via optimized initialization

### Changed
- **Branchless worktree architecture** — eliminated slice branches entirely. All work commits sequentially on `milestone/<MID>` within auto-mode worktrees. No branch creation, switching, or merging within a worktree. ~2600 lines of merge/conflict/branch-switching code removed.
- **`.gitignore` overhaul** — planning artifacts (`.gsd/milestones/`) are tracked in git naturally. Only runtime files are gitignored. No more force-add hacks.
- **Multi-milestone enforcement** — `depends_on` frontmatter enforced in multi-milestone CONTEXT.md

### Fixed
- **Auto-mode loop detection failures** — artifacts on wrong branch or invisible after branch switch no longer possible (root cause eliminated by branchless architecture)
- **Nested worktree creation** — auto-mode no longer creates worktrees inside existing manual worktrees, preventing wrong-repo state reads and "All milestones complete" false positives
- **Dispatch recovery hardening** — artifact fallback when completion key missing, TUI freeze prevention on cascading skips, reentrancy guard, atomic writes, stale runtime record cleanup, git index.lock cleanup
- **Hook orchestration** — finalize runtime records, add supervision, fix retry
- **Empty slice plan stays in planning** — no longer incorrectly transitions to summarizing
- **Prefs wizard** — launch directly from `/gsd prefs`, fix parse/serialize cycle for empty arrays
- **Discussion routing** — `/gsd discuss` routes to draft when phase is needs-discussion

### Removed
- `ensureSliceBranch()`, `switchToMain()`, `mergeSliceToMain()`, `mergeSliceToMilestone()`
- `shouldUseWorktreeIsolation()`, `getMergeToMainMode()`, `buildFixMergePrompt()`
- `withMergeHeal()`, `recoverCheckout()`, `fix-merge` unit type
- `git.isolation` and `git.merge_to_main` preferences (deprecated with warnings)

## [2.13.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Windows: multi-line commit messages in `mergeSliceToMilestone` broke shell parsing — switched to `execFileSync` with argument arrays
- Windows: single-quoted git arguments and bash-only redirects in test files
- Windows: worktree path normalization for `shouldUseWorktreeIsolation` and stale branch detection

## [2.13.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Worktree isolation for auto-mode** — auto-mode creates isolated git worktrees per milestone, with `--no-ff` slice merges preserving commit history and squash merge to main on milestone completion
- **Self-healing git repair** — automatic recovery from detached HEAD, stale locks, and orphaned worktrees
- **Worktree-aware doctor** — git health diagnostics and worktree integrity checks
- **Isolation preferences** — choose between worktree and branch isolation modes

### Fixed
- **Dispatch loop: parse cache stale data** — `dispatchNextUnit()` cleared path cache but not parse cache, allowing stale roadmap checkbox state to persist through doctor→dispatch transitions (#462)
- **Dispatch loop: completion not persisted after agent session** — `handleAgentEnd()` now verifies artifacts and persists the completion key before re-entering the dispatch loop, preventing re-dispatch when `deriveState()` sees pre-merge branch state (#462)
- **Dispatch loop: recovery counter reset without persistence** — loop-recovery and self-repair paths now persist completion keys and include a hard lifetime dispatch cap of 6 (#462, #463)
- **Dispatch loop: non-execute-task units had no artifact verification** — `complete-slice`, `plan-slice`, and other unit types now verify artifacts on disk before bail-out (#465)
- `@` file autocomplete debounced to prevent TUI freeze on large codebases (#452)
- Guard against newer synced resources from future versions (#445)
- Prevent `web_search` tool injection for non-Anthropic providers serving Claude models (#446)

## [2.12.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Parallel tool calling** — tools from a single assistant message execute concurrently by default, with sequential mode as opt-in (`toolExecution: "sequential"`) and `beforeToolCall`/`afterToolCall` hooks for interception
- **Ollama Cloud** as model and web tool provider
- **Extensible hook system** for auto-mode state machine — post-unit hooks fire after unit completion
- **Event queue settlement** for parallel tool execution — extension `tool_call`/`tool_result` handlers always see settled agent state

### Changed
- Inline static templates into prompt builders, eliminating ~44 READ tool calls per milestone

### Fixed
- Auto-mode dispatch loop when `cachedReaddir` returns stale data after unit writes files
- Parse and path caches cleared alongside state cache after unit completion
- `bg_shell` hangs indefinitely when `ready_port` server fails to start — now transitions to error state with stderr context
- Em dash and slash characters in milestone/slice titles corrupting GSD state management
- Guided-flow self-heals stale runtime records from crashed auto-mode sessions on wizard start
- CI smoke test ANSI code stripping

## [2.11.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **URGENT: auto-mode loops on research-slice and plan-slice** — `handleAgentEnd` called `invalidateStateCache()` but not `clearPathCache()` or `clearParseCache()`. The in-process directory listing cache in `paths.ts` retained the pre-subagent empty directory snapshot, so `resolveSliceFile()` returned `null` for artifacts the subagent had just written. This caused `dispatchNextUnit` to re-dispatch the same unit (`research-slice` or `plan-slice`) instead of advancing, incrementing the dispatch counter until the `MAX_UNIT_DISPATCHES=3` limit triggered a hard stop with "Loop detected" (#421)

## [2.11.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Cross-provider fallback when rate or quota limits are hit (#125)
- Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint option in onboarding wizard (#335)
- Model provider selection in preferences (#350)
- Auto-mode fallback model rotation on network errors (#386)
- Native libgit2-backed git read operations for dispatch hotpath (#388)

### Changed
- Replace hardcoded extension list with dynamic discovery in loader
- Deduplicate transitive dependency summaries in prompt builders
- Reduce dispatch gap timeout from 30s to 5s
- Memoize `deriveState()` per dispatch cycle
- Wire native batch parser into `deriveState()` hotpath (#389)
- Add session-scoped directory listing cache and content-hash-keyed parse cache for path resolution
- Optimize discovery and interactive hot paths

### Fixed
- Resolve OpenRouter model IDs in auto-mode and show active model per phase
- Suppress git-svn noise causing confusing errors on affected systems (#404)
- Include export-html templates in pkg/ shim (#370, #395)
- Increase timeout for z.ai provider to handle slow API spikes (#379, #396)
- Prevent login dialog from leaving dangling promises that freeze the UI (#280, #390)
- Improve Cloud Code Assist 404 error with actionable model guidance (#384)
- Prevent auto-mode hang when dispatch chain breaks after slice tasks complete (#381, #382)
- Fix packaging verification and path portability (#378)
- Read resources from dist/ to prevent branch-drift in npm-link setups (#314)
- Always use native Anthropic web search when available (#374)
- CI smoke test — wait for registry propagation, show errors (#383)
- Bypass pre-commit hooks on GSD infrastructure commits to prevent lint-staged empty commit errors (#385)

## [2.10.12] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Multi-milestone readiness flow with per-milestone discussion gate (#377)

### Fixed
- Fix `npx gsd-pi@latest` failing with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package '@gsd/pi-coding-agent'`. The loader now creates workspace package symlinks at runtime before importing, so it works even when `npx` skips postinstall scripts (#380)

## [2.10.11] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- Hoist workspace package dependencies (undici, anthropic SDK, openai, chalk, etc.) into root `dependencies` so they install for end users. v2.10.10 removed `bundleDependencies` but didn't promote the transitive deps (#376)
- Add `undici` as root dependency to resolve startup crash (#372)
- Check `GROQ_API_KEY` before entering voice mode to prevent crash (#367)

## [2.10.10] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Alibaba Cloud coding-plan provider support (#295)
- Linux voice mode: Groq Whisper API backend for fast, accurate speech-to-text (#366)
- Opus 4.6 1M as default model, model selector UX improvements, Discord onboarding (#290)

### Fixed
- Fix broken `npm install` / `npx gsd-pi@latest` caused by unpublished `@gsd/*` workspace packages leaking into npm dependencies. Workspace cross-references removed from published package metadata; packages resolve via bundled `node_modules/` at runtime (#369)
- Add pre-publish tarball install validation (`validate-pack`) to CI and publish pipeline, preventing broken packages from reaching npm
- Handle empty index after runtime file stripping in squash-merge (#364)
- Add retry logic for transient network/auth failures instead of crashing (#365)
- Auto-mode: stale lock detection, SIGTERM handler, live-session guard (#362)

## [2.10.9] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Heavyweight plan sections (Proof Level, Integration Closure, Observability) are now conditional, omitted for simple slices

### Fixed
- Squash-merge now aborts cleanly on conflict and stops auto-mode instead of looping with corrupted state
- Resolved baked-in merge conflict markers in loader.ts, logo.ts, and postinstall.js

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
